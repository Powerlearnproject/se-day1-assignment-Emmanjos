# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Basically software Engineering is like writing  a code that is within the realm of what to do between frontend or backend, or process of designing Maintaining and innovation ,Testing and developing software , Like Youtube has to run well.
Critical in supporting Business growth and innovation.
Making life easier and more convinient through programs and application.
Security threats and privacy concerns, software engineering plays a role by protecting sensitive information and mitigate potential risks

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
What happened?: Before this time, computer programs were messy and hard to understand, like mixed wires. Programmers would write code that was all tangled and confusing.
What changed?: People started organizing their code better, using clear steps and rules, so it was easier to read and fix. 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s)
programmers started grouping things together in a smart way, so they could build big programs out of small, simple pieces.
By Grouping things in a smart way programmers could reuse their code and make changes more easily. so you dont have to start from scratch each time
Agile and DevOps (2000s-present)
Before this time, creating a program could take a long time, and sometimes people would only see the results after months of work. But programmers realized it was better to show small updates regularly and ask for feedback to make sure the program is getting better.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
